# Project No2 Investigate a Dataset
This is my repository for the second project of the Data Analyst Nanodegree Project from Udacity.

# Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed the "Medical Appointment No Shows" dataset provided by JoniHoppen on Kaggle, and then communicated my findings about it.
For my analysis, I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.
