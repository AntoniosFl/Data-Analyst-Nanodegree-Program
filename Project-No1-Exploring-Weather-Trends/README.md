# Project Summary

This was the first project of the Data Analysis Nanodegree on Udacity. I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends of Hamburg to overall global temperature trends.

I used SQL to query the data,Excel to handle the data and perform a few moving averages calculations, and lastly visually compare the difference in increase rates over time using a line chart. In the end I did a brief analysis on the observations.
