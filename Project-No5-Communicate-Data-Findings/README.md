# Project Overview

This project has two parts:
 - In the first part, I used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore the  "_Airline on-time performance_" dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.
 - In the second part, I created a short presentation that illustrates various properties, trends, and relationships discovered in the _"Airline on-time performance"_  dataset.
 
The primary method of conveying my findings was through the transformation of the exploratory visualizations from the first part into explanatory visualizations.

In this project, I used the following libraries:
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - Seaborn
 
 ### The selected dataset: _Airline on-time performance_

This dataset consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA for the year 2008.
